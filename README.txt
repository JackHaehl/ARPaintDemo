How to Install ARPaint
- On any Android Phone, download the apk above
- If you attended Sunhacks in-person, get the gameboy sticker ready.
- If you don't have the gameboy sticker, print "ARTarget.png" it should
be about 3 inches wide, if it's not it shouldn't be too much of a problem though.
- Run the apk and click past the many, many warnings.
- Now the app should be open!

Usage instructions:
- Hold the target up to the screen until a cube appears, if it does not appear,
try holding it closer to the screen and make sure the target is completely flat.
- The more details in the background of your screen, the better the tracking will be
- When the cube appears on the target, press the plus and move it around to draw!
- Press the plus again to stop drawing
- The 4 sliders change the color and the size of the drawn objects!

Have fun!
